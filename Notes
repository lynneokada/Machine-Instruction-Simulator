Client sends to server (via struct or strings or whatever)
	-need to check how many bytes are being read/sent

Server reads data in line by line and stored as vector<vector<string>>
Spawns client thread and begins execution based on the vector it receives
	-Client threads can spawn worker threads to perform a subset of instructions based on thread begin/end
	-Stores output in an output buffer that contains a mutex so that it can only be written to by a single worker
		-Make function to write to output buffer that uses class mutex to lock writing
Once data is all done, return output buffer line by line to the client again and signal that it is done with execution

Client receives data from output buffer and will now write it to the file to be outputted
	-need to make sure not to mix up error and output buffers (needs 2 stop flags)


Make sure to parse individual words on server side


Behavior still unknown:
	-How does reading from buffer work with queued amount of strings incoming
	-Length of time from sending data to being able to read output data
