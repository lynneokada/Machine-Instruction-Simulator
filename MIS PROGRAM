MIS PROGRAM

Variable handling options:
	Array/Vector of single type
		-Key/Value mapping
			-Third party library
			-Make our own
			-Find a way to natively do it
			-Hashing
		-Map by index (use binary search?)
			-Process file twice (once for # of vars and second for filling values)
			-Fill values at same time (allocate space dynamically)
	Dynamic variable creations
		-Doesn't look possible

Function handling:
-Switch statement (not optimal)


Labels
-Store in array/vector with line # and name


Ask about:
-Can variables be created mid-function
-Better example of how to declare a variable
-How to implement calling of functions
